This repository contains practical notebooks for COMP2200/COMP6200 for Session S1-2022 @ Macquarie University.

This repository will contain the practical notebooks for COMP2200/COMP6200 Session S1, 2022. The initial repository has one notebook for the first week. Each week, I will add a new notebook and commit your changes as I complete the problems set for you. At the end of the semester, I will have this repository as a record of your work. This can then form part of my ongoing portfolio of work.

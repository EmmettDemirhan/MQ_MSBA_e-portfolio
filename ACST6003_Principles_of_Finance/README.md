The coursework covers an array of topics, from basic financial mathematics and capital markets to complex instruments like derivatives. Within this framework, I've focused on a variety of projects and analyses to enhance my practical skills.

### Key Projects & Skills Developed

#### 1. Financial Modeling Assignment

In this assignment, I analyzed financial models presented in an Excel workbook named `Corporate_Valuation_Report.xlsx`.

For this case study, I adopted the role of a financial analyst to scrutinize a real-world scenario involving a potential investment in a new oven to increase the company's production capacity.

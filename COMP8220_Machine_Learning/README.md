# COMP8220 Machine Learning Unit

This unit covers machine learning techniques starting from basic classifiers and regression models to deep learning. The unit starts with conventional machine learning techniques like Naive Bayes, decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines. The latter part of the unit focuses on state-of-the-art methods such as deep learning.

## Assessments Completed

### Question 1
- Explored relationships between nutrition variables in Starbucks dataset using R.
- Checked data centering and standardization.
- Conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Determined number of components explaining 95% variance.

### Question 2
- Simulated independent random samples \(X\) and \(Y\) in R.
- Calculated values of pooled estimators \(T1\) and \(T2\).
- Used bootstrapping to construct histograms for \(T1\) and \(T2\).
- Evaluated the performance of each estimator.

### Question 3
- Derived likelihood and log-likelihood functions for \(\theta\).
- Computed Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of \(\theta\).
- Calculated Cramér-Rao Lower Bound for unbiased estimators of \(\theta\).
- Compared the variance of \(MLE\) with Cramér-Rao Lower Bound.

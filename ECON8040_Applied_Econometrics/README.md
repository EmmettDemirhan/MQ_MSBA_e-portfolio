# ECON8040 Applied Econometrics Unit
The objective of this unit is to elevate students with basic statistical knowledge to a practical level where they can apply their knowledge of econometrics to empirical analysis. The unit starts with a brief review of the standard multiple linear regression model and the OLS estimation method. It then covers alternative estimation methods and culminates in discrete-choice models.

## Assignment

### Empirical Analysis of Worker's Compensation Laws
- **Author**: UMUT DEMIRHAN | 46739106 | [Your Degree]
- **Semester**: S1 2023
- **Technologies**: Gretl, other statistical software
- **Details**: The assignment focuses on the empirical analysis of changes in worker's compensation laws in the states of Kentucky and Michigan during the 1980s. The objective is to test the hypothesis that changes in the maximum benefit did not affect the length of time that high-income workers spend away from work due to temporary total disability.
- **Submission**: A written report in PDF format and a Gretl session file are required for the submission. The report should be less than 1500 words and should not include appendices. Tables and figures should be included within the text at the points where they are discussed.

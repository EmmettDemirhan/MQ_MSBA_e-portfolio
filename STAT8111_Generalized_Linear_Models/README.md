# STAT8111 Generalized Linear Models

## Unit Overview
This unit covers the broad spectrum of generalized linear models, starting with classical normal linear regression and extending to models for various types of responses. The focus is on deriving maximum likelihood estimators, model selection, hypothesis testing, and practical applications using statistical software. Key areas include models for counted, binary, continuous non-normal, and categorical responses, along with generalized additive models and models for correlated responses.
